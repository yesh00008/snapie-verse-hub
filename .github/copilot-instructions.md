<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->
- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements
	<!-- WhatsApp clone with React, Node.js, Socket.IO, Firebase Auth, MongoDB, enhanced features -->

- [x] Scaffold the Project
	<!--
	✅ Created full-stack WhatsApp clone project structure:
	- React TypeScript client with Material-UI, Firebase, Socket.IO
	- Node.js Express server with TypeScript, Socket.IO, MongoDB
	- Authentication middleware and Firebase integration
	- Real-time messaging components and chat interface
	-->

- [x] Customize the Project
	<!--
	✅ Successfully customized to Snapie messaging platform:
	- Rebranded from WhatsApp Clone to Snapie with purple gradient theme
	- Integrated real Firebase authentication with phone verification
	- Added enhanced features: voice messages, file sharing, message reactions
	- Implemented advanced UI with Material-UI components and animations
	- Added group chat support, message replies, and context menus
	-->

- [ ] Install Required Extensions
	<!-- ONLY install extensions provided mentioned in the get_project_setup_info. Skip this step otherwise and mark as completed. -->

- [x] Compile the Project
	<!--
	✅ Successfully compiled Snapie React client and Node.js server
	- Client runs on http://localhost:3000 with Firebase authentication
	- Server runs on http://localhost:5000 with Socket.IO ready
	- Real Firebase config integrated with phone verification
	- Enhanced UI with purple gradient theme and advanced features
	-->

- [ ] Create and Run Task
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Check https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks to determine if the project needs a task. If so, use the create_and_run_task to create and launch a task based on package.json, README.md, and project structure.
	Skip this step otherwise.
	 -->

- [ ] Launch the Project
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Prompt user for debug mode, launch only if confirmed.
	 -->

- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Verify that README.md and the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists and contains current project information.
	Clean up the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory by removing all HTML comments.

## Execution Guidelines
PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.
- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Code—do not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

FOLDER CREATION RULES:
- Always use the current directory as the project root.
- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.
- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.
- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in vscode.

EXTENSION INSTALLATION RULES:
- Only install extension specified by the get_project_setup_info tool. DO NOT INSTALL any other extensions.

PROJECT CONTENT RULES:
- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a "Hello World" project as a starting point.
- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.
- Avoid generating images, videos, or any other media files unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual assets later.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.
- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.

TASK COMPLETION RULES:
- Your task is complete when:
  - Project is successfully scaffolded and compiled without errors
  - copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists in the project
  - README.md file exists and is up to date
  - User is provided with clear instructions to debug/launch the project

Before starting a new task in the above plan, update progress in the plan.
-->
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
